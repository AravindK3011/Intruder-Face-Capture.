# Intruder-Face-Capture.

Code by Tejas Krishna Reddy
June 2016.

A small but very usefull project.

A detailed explanation of the algorithm used in the code is explained in the report attached in the repository.

Here, the webcam captures pics in a 'forever' loop creating a live video in which each frame is tested if a face is in it. Incase, a face is detected, then that face would be Cropped and saved in a folder in your PC/ Laptop.

This project is the basis for dozens of other projects that are done by myself and my friends.

Applications:
1. Live Face recognition - each detected and cropped image can parallelly be processed to recognise the face.
2. Automatic attendence in Classrooms.
3. Creating your own database for further analysis/ other projects. This is a very easy method as compared to taking each pic and saving it in a folder.
4. Emotion Recognition. refer https://github.com/Tejas1415/Emotion_recognition 
And many more

### With the same code above, if u pass the parameters as eyes, mouth, nose etc, only those parts will be detected and cropped to create a databse of eyes etc as demanded by the project.
